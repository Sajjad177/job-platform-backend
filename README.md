# HireMe – Job Posting Platform (Backend)

A robust backend API built with **Express.js** and **MongoDB** for a job posting platform where companies can post jobs and job seekers can apply by uploading resumes and making payments. The system uses secure JWT authentication and implements role-based access control for Admins, Employees (Recruiters), and Job Seekers.

---

## Features

- **Role-Based Authentication & Authorization**  
  Secure JWT authentication with permission checks for Admins, Employees, and Job Seekers.

- **Job & User Management**  
  Admins can manage users and jobs; Employees can post and manage their company’s jobs and applicants.

- **Resume Upload**  
  Job Seekers can upload CVs (PDF/DOCX) with file size and type validation using Multer.

- **Payment Integration**  
  Mock payment system requiring 100 Taka payment to apply for jobs, with invoice storage.

- **Application Management**  
  Employees can accept or reject applicants; Job Seekers can view their application history.
